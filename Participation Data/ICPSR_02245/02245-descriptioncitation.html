		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This dataset contains records for each public elementary
 and secondary school in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and
 outlying areas (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
 and the Marshall Islands) for 1980-1981. Each public elementary and
 secondary school is identified by the local education agency (LEA)
 to which it belongs. Data were reported to National Center for
 Education Statistics by the state education agencies. Records in this
 file provide the name and address of the school, name of the school
 district or other education agency that operates the school, type code
 for the school, number of full-time equivalent classroom teachers, and
the fall enrollment.</span></p>
